"""
You are given a matrix of integers matrix of size n Ã— m and a list of queries.
The given matrix is colored in black and white in a checkerboard style - the top left corner is colored white and any
two side-neighboring cells have opposite colors.
Example

For

matrix = [[2, 0, 4],
          [2, 8, 5],
          [6, 0, 9],
          [2, 7, 10],
          [4, 3, 4]]
and queries = [[0, 0], [1, 3]], the output should be

meanAndChessboard(matrix, queries) = [[1, 2, 4],
                                      [2, 8, 5],
                                      [6, 0, 9],
                                      [2, 7, 10],
                                      [4, 3, 3]]
The average of the 0th black cell and the 0th white cell is (0 + 2) / 2 = 1, so both cells are replaced with 1.
The average of the 1st black cell and the 3rd white cell is (1 + 4) / 2 = 2.5, so the 1 is replaced with floor(2.5) = 2
and the 4 is replaced with ceil(2.5) = 3.
